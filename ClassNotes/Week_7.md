## New Getting Help Policy
* As we move into the second half it's important to start working the way you will need to at a company. I will still be just as available, but the process will change. Please post in Slack before coming to me. If you aren't able to articulate the problem, at least mention the assignment and the task you are stuck on.
* Other's may then agree they are also stuck there, or offer help. If multiple students are having the same issue, I'll get together with everyone at once.
* Once you've posted, as soon as I'm free, I'll come find you, or ask you to come find me.
* Before asking for help, be sure you have first reviewed my class notes, and then any relevant resources.

## Halfway Gifts
* Two tools you may start using now.

### GitHub for Mac
